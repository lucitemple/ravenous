# About [Ravenous](https://lucitemple.github.io/ravenous/)

- Create React App
- cors-anywhere
- node.js & npm

### Warning regarding cors-anywhere
Please note that [cors-anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) is used as a temporary workaround to CORS related issues which occur when developing a front-end app without a backend. In a commercial environment a project would have a backend and not need this CORS workaround.

The limitation of cors-anywhere is that access to this service is temporary. It runs out. Which stops the API from working, until access is requested manually from [cors-anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo). Access lasts maybe one or two days only. 

It is fine to use as a stop-gap in development, or for people like myself who are building sample projects to develop and practice skills rather than for serious use, however is not a long term solution.


### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
